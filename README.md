### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)
